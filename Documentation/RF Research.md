- [This thread](https://www.mail-archive.com/wireless@wispa.org/msg16996.html) on the WISPA mailing list 
  describing a similar network:

    I have two towers running MT APs at 5.8 with CM9s and 16 dBi horiz
    sectors.  Using Osbridge 5GXi's as the CPE, I have clients a few miles
    out with non-LOS and the occasional treeline without any issues.

    I also have one house about 3/4 mile away from my tower that's going
    through nearly 1/4 mile of scattered trees.  It attenuates pretty
    badly during heavy rain until the leaves on the trees dry out, but
    stays connected.  It's my parents-in-law's house, so they're a little
    more forgiving if it happens to drop than a client would be ;)

- At 5.8Ghz, shoot for -51dBm or better [ref](https://community.ubnt.com/t5/airMAX-General-Discussion/Minimum-Signal/td-p/219055)
